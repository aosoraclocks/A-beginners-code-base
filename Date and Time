Saw a time printer and thought i'd put the one i had here:

import datetime

now = datetime.datetime.now()

#To get the entire date including millisecond
print (now)

#To show a single affix of the date exluding millisecond 
#because i think it's ugly.
print("This is your year:")
print(now.year)
print("This is your month:")
print(now.month)
print("This is your day:")
print(now.day)
print("This is your hour:")
print(now.hour)
print("This is your minute:")
print(now.minute)
print("This is your second:")
print(now.second)
